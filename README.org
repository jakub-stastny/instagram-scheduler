* About

IG scheduler that retrieves the first picture in a drop box directory on Google Drive (or possibly Dropbox) and uploads it to Instagram.

It's meant to run with cron from Tuesday to Sunday at 9 AM:

#+begin_src cron
  0 9 * * 2-7 /path/to/my-script.sh
#+end_src

** Instagram API limitations
- JPEG is the only image format supported.
- Images must be passed as public URLs.

* Run

#+begin_src sh
  export IG_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your-ig-access-token>"
  export IG_ACCOUNT_ID="<your-ig-account-id>"

  clojure -M:run "https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1q5KFq5ZhK4HYaI_KeiRgo_9_JBD7VBNQ&export=download"
#+end_src
